# Statistical Data Analysis (MATLAB / Excel)

## Project Overview
This project focuses on applying statistical data analysis techniques to real-world datasets in order to design, test, and validate a statistical hypothesis. The work emphasizes data-driven decision making, proper use of inferential statistics, and clear presentation of results.

The project was completed as part of an engineering statistics course at Concordia University and carried out in a team-based environment.

## Objectives
- Formulate a statistical hypothesis based on real-world data
- Collect and analyze a sufficient sample size (50+ samples)
- Apply hypothesis testing and confidence interval methods
- Interpret results and draw statistically valid conclusions
- Present findings clearly using tables and visualizations

## Methodology
- Collected and preprocessed real-world datasets
- Selected appropriate statistical models and tests
- Performed hypothesis testing and confidence interval calculations in MATLAB
- Organized, cleaned, and visualized data using Microsoft Excel
- Verified assumptions and validated results through analysis

## Tools & Technologies
- MATLAB (statistical analysis, hypothesis testing, confidence intervals)
- Microsoft Excel (data organization, cleaning, visualization)

## Teamwork
- Completed in a team of 5
- Collaborated on data collection, analysis, interpretation, and reporting
- Shared responsibilities for validation and result presentation

## Skills Demonstrated
- Statistical analysis and hypothesis testing
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- MATLAB programming for data analysis
- Excel-based data organization and visualization
